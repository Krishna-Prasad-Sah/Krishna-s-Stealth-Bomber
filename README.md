# Krishna-s-Stealth-Bomber
This repository presents the conceptual design and preliminary analysis of a stealth strategic bomber, inspired by the Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit flying wing configuration. The project focuses on low observability, aerodynamic efficiency, and long range performance, using fundamental aerospace design principles and simulation-based analysis.
